# Actions
This is a very rough idea right now. Any input is welcome.

AI-Kingdoms main "gameplay" element is watching a world evolve as the characters in it are born, age, have children themselves and finally die. "Actions" is what allows the player to influence this world.

Games that implement something similar usually assign a difficulty rating and give a failure chance depending on the difficulty. I think that is inherently frustrating. Instead the cost will scale with the difficulty. So if in a game a action would have just 10% chance to succeed in AI-Kingdoms that action would instead cost 10 times as much.

The cost of a action are so called "Action-Points", which slowly accumulate over time. For the player this should give the feeling of sheming for years until they can finally execute their plan. Some actions have a additional monetary cost, but this never scales with the difficulty of the action.s

## Court Decisions
- Things that affect the whole realm or the court itself.
- Examples: Declaration of War, Forming a Alliance, Giving somebody a high rank, Assigning a governor to a city
- Cost depends on the opinion of the two chancellors. Cheap if they agree, costy if one chancellor opposes it, extremly costy if both opose it.

## Personal Decisions
- Things that don't require anyones consent. On the one side crimes, on the other side personal matters.
- Examples: Assassination, Befriending somebody, Seduction, Planting Evidence.
- Cost depends on the difficulty, which is calculated differently for each Action.
